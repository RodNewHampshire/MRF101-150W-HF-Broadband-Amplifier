# MRF101-150W-HF-Broadband-Amplifier

The MRF101 amplifier is based on the NXP MRF101 RF Power LDMOS Transistors.

This build nominally provides 150W on 80m through 17m. Output is ~100W on 160m. I haven’t run the amp on 12m or 10m at this time due to an instability in my
transmitter.

This amplifier requires Low Pass Filters at its output to meet FCC requirements. I used Low Pass Filters from W6PQL (www.w6pql.com/a_1.5kw_lpf_for_160-6m.htm).
