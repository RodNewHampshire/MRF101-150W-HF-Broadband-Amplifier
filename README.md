# MRF101-150W-HF-Broadband-Amplifier

The MRF101 amplifier is based on the NXP MRF101 RF Power LDMOS Transistors.

This build nominally provides 150W on 40m through 12m. Output is currently lower on 160m, 80m, and 10m.

This amplifier requires Low Pass Filters at its output to meet FCC requirements. I used Low Pass Filters from W6PQL (www.w6pql.com/a_1.5kw_lpf_for_160-6m.htm).
