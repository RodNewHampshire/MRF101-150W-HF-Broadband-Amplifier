# MRF101-150W-HF-Broadband-Amplifier

The MRF101 amplifier is based on the NXP MRF101 RF Power LDMOS Transistors.

This build nominally provides 150W on 80m through 17m. Output is ~100W on 160m. I havenâ€™t run the amp on 12m or 10m at this time due to an instability in my
transmitter.

This amplifier requires Low Pass Filters at its output to meet FCC requirements. Low Pass Filters from W6PQL housed in a separate enclosure are used with this 
amplifier. I decided to mount the Low Pass Filters in a separate HP436a chassis for space reasons and to allow them to be used for other amplifier projects.
